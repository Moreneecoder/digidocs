# DigiDocs-API:Microverse Final Capstone Project

> A Ruby On Rails API for booking and managing appointments with doctors.

## About This Project
DigiDocs is a backend service that houses and serves data for booking doctors' appointments. It is an API with its own endpoints that can be interfaced with. A client app can request details of a user, a users' list of appointments, a list of doctors and even send required details to book appointments with a doctor.

## Built With

- Ruby v3.0.0
- Ruby on Rails 6
- PostgreSQL
- RSpec

## Getting Started

To set up a local version of this project, a collection of steps have been put together to help guide you from installations to usage. Simply follow the guide below and you'll be up and running in no time.

### Set up Project

- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install [the Ruby programming language](https://ruby-doc.org/downloads/), if you haven't already.
- - Install [the Ruby on Rails MVC Framework](https://rubyonrails.org/), if you haven't already.
- Open Terminal
- Navigate to the preferred location/folder you want the app on your local machine. Use `cd <file-path>` for this.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Moreneecoder/digidocs-api.git` to download the project source code.
- Now that you have a local copy of the project, navigate to the root of the project folder from your terminal.
- Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies in the Gemfile file.

### Set up Database
- This project uses [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so ensure you have that installed first
- Run the commands below to create and migrate database
```
   rails db:create
   rails db:reset
   rails db:migrate
```

## Running Tests
- Rubocop: This is a tool for checking code quality and ensuring they meet the requirements. Microverse provides a wonderful setup guide for [rubocop here](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/ror).

- RSpec: This is a tool for testing the effectiveness of the program's logic at every step. To set up RSpec:
  - run `gem install rspec` in your terminal. This should install rspec globally on your local machine.
  - run `rspec --version`. This should display your rspec version if successfully installed.
  - run `rspec` to see passing and failing tests.

### Usage

- Start server with: `rails server`

- Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
